ComfyUI node to make text to speech audio with your own voice.

Using F5-TTS https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS


### Instructions

* Put in ComfyUI's "input/voices" folder a .wav file of an audio of the voice you'd like to use, remove any background music, noise.
* And a .txt file of the same name with what was said.
* Press refresh to see it in the node

* `input/F5-TTS` `input/audio` folders will also work.

You can use the examples here...
* [Examples voices](example_workflows/)
* [Simple workflow](example_workflows/simple_ComfyUI_F5TTS_workflow.json)
* [Workflow with input audio only, using OpenAI's Whisper to get the text](example_workflows/F5TTS_whisper_workflow.json)
* [Workflow with all features](example_workflows/F5TTS-test-all.json)

### Other languages / custom models...

You can put the model & vocab txt files into "models/checkpoints/F5-TTS" folder if you have any more models.  Name the .txt vocab file and the .pt model file the same names.  Press "refresh" and it should appear under the "model" selection.

### Multi voices output...

Use the `F5-TTS Audio` node(not the from input node).

Put your sample voice files into the "input/voices" folder like...
```
bob.wav
bob.txt
deep.wav
deep.txt
chipmunk.wav
chipmunk.txt
```

Then you can use prompts for different voices...
```
{bob} Hello World this is the end
{deep} This is the narrator
{chipmunk} Please, I need more helium
```

### Multi voice input...

Put a sentence of voice 1 and a sentence from voice 2 into the input audio sample.  F5-TTS cuts the audio off at 15 seconds so don't make it too long.
[Example](https://github.com/niknah/ComfyUI-F5-TTS/issues/29)

### BigVGAN models.

To use BigVGAN, you have to add a little dot to make it work with ComfyUI...

In the file `custom_nodes/ComfyUI-F5-TTS/F5-TTS/src/third_party/BigVGAN/bigvgan.py`

Add a little dot on the line at the top that says...

`from utils import init_weights, get_padding`

so it's becomes...

`from .utils import init_weights, get_padding`


### Tips...

 * F5-TTS [cuts your voice sample off at 15 secs](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS/blob/8898d05e374bcb8d3fc0b1286037e95df61f491f/src/f5_tts/infer/utils_infer.py#L315).   It may cut off in the middle of a word and not cut the text only audio.   Make sure your input samples are less than 15 secs.
 * If you're using the ComfyUI-Whisper node you will also need to install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)


### Install from git

It's best to install from ComfyUI-manager because it will update all your custom\_nodes when you click "update all".  With git, you will have to update manually.

Clone this repository into custom\_nodes and run this to install from git
```
cd custom_nodes/ComfyUI-F5-TTS
git submodule update --init --recursive
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Changes

1.0.19: Added model\_type.
